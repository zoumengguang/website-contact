# Notes
- Authentication is provided by AWS Amplify's Auth service.

- Required .env file should be attached to the email.

- Files inside the AWS folder are copies of the Lambda functions required for the challenge. 
These are purely for ease of reference and are not used in the front end.

- Since e-mail sending through AWS SES only works through verified domains/emails through the service
it's easiest to test functionality by using the account email websitecontactapp@gmail.com, which is pre-verified. 
Alternatively verify another email in SES to serve as another valid candidate for testing email sending/receiving. 

- WebsiteContactFunc is the GET Lambda Function used to test data fetching from DynamoDB,
- WebsiteContactWrite is the POST Lambda Function responsible for POST/PUT operations
  into DynamoDB as well as sending an email copy of the message through AWS SES.
